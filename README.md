# Camera_Calibration using ComputerVision
Calculate Camera intrinsic parameter including intrinsic and distortion matrix using Chessboard Images

## Prepare a Chessboard Image:  
1) Use a standard chessboard image for calibration. Typically, an 8x6 or 9x6 chessboard is used, where 8 and 9 are the number of squares along row and 6 is the number of square along column.[Reference Image](https://github.com/devanjanmishra/ComputerVision_Camera_Calibration/assets/50066136/b61d375f-1170-4c86-afd9-a0661ddb442d) has 9 square along rows and 6 along columns.
2) Ensure that the chessboard squares are of equal size and the image is clear and well-lit. You can use [chessboard_creation](https://github.com/devanjanmishra/ComputerVision_Camera_Calibration/blob/main/create_sample_chessboard_image.py) script to create your own image image.  
3) Print the chessboard pattern on paper and capture images of it using your camera from different angles. Sample images are stored in [chessboard_image_folder](https://github.com/devanjanmishra/ComputerVision_Camera_Calibration/tree/main/chessboard_images) folder.
