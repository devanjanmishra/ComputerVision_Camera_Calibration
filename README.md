# ComputerVision_Camera_Calibration
Calculate Camera intrinsic parameter including intrinsic and distortion matrix using Chessboard Images

Prepare a Chessboard Image:  
1) Use a standard chessboard image for calibration. Typically, an 8x6 or 9x6 chessboard is used, where 8 and 9 are the number of internal corners per row and 6 is the number of internal corners per column.  
2) Ensure that the chessboard squares are of equal size and the image is clear and well-lit. You can use [chessboard_creation.py](https://github.com/devanjanmishra/ComputerVision_Camera_Calibration/blob/main/create_sample_chessboard_image.py) to create the image.  
3) You can print a chessboard pattern on paper and capture images of it using your camera from different angles.  
4) Sample images are present in [chessboard_image_folder](https://github.com/devanjanmishra/ComputerVision_Camera_Calibration/tree/main/chessboard_images)  
5)
